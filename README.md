This is an e-store made with Next.js, Typescript, MongoDB, E-commerece and a Payload template

It has an admin panel to manage and control content, products, categories, etc...

Thanks to my teacher and the project author [JavaScript Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/@javascriptmastery)

I made a few changes to improve the project, like specifing the currency of the store (with its icon) in the .env file, adding warnings to the seeding button, removing unnecessary buttons, etc...
