This is an e-store made with Next.js, Typescript, MongoDB and a Payload template

It has an admin panel to manage and control content, products, categories, etc...

I made a few more changes to improve the project, like specifing the currency of the store (with its icon) in the .env file, adding warnings to the seeding button, removing unnecessary buttons, out of stock label if price == 0, etc...
